# ftg_linlib
My personal KiCad parts library.
As such it can include faulty footprints and schematic symbols.
Incomplete symbols.
Dumb hacks.

Please don't use it for anything, as it is not fit for any purpose and does not come with any kind of warranty or guarantees.

Format is KiCad 6. But I'm currently using 6.99 nightly from the ppa, so that's what these will conform to.
